Lets say you create a script that can be consumed by thousands of transactions, all of these nodes will have to include the script 
in their output which increases the size of the blockchain.

Since the Vasil hardfork, reference scripts can be used as a solution to this problem. Previosly, a txn o/p consists of an address, 
a value and an optional datum... now we can optionally include a script too. Then, when a txn wants to spend such UTxOs, it doesn't 
have to include the script but instead it points to the UTxO that has this script attached.

It's costly to create this reference script o/ps but its cheap to use them. (the pointer is smaller than the script)
To make these UTxOs holding the scripts accessible, it can be put in some arbitrary UTxO, or in our own wallet (for testing), but it
is advisable to put it somewhere inaccessible (like the BURN script). The 'burn' script ignores it's three arguments and always
produces an error... its impossible to spend any UTxO located at the address of the burn script. The existence of the script is 
reliable and you can hardcode the address of the script in the TxOutRef
