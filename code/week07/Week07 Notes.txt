Consider a scenario where two people (alice and bob) play a game. In this game, both alice and bob have to choose a number from 0 or 1. If they both choose the same
number, Alice wins, otherwise Bob wins.
Lets say they are playing this game over a network where only one of them can send their choice at once. This is how it's implemented
    Alice -> prevHash = Hash (nonce + 0) -> Bob
    Bob -> 0 -> Alice (Alice wins)
    Alice -> Reveal (nonce + 0) -> Bob
    Bob Hash (nonce + 0) compare prevHash 
    Alice -> Claims stake

    Or

    Bob -> 1 -> Alice (Bob wins)
    Alice -> sends nothing and waits until time passes (sore loser)
    Bob -> Claims prize


** This scenario is implemented in the module EvenOdd.hs
